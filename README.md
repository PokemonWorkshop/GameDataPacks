## Structure of the repository
This repository is divided in 9 folders, each of them corresponds to Pokémon generation and is subdivided in as many folder as there are game version in this generations.

Each version folder is structured as follows:

|           Folder | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|          `audio` | Folder containing the files for Pokémon cries                                                |
|           `Data` | Folder containing the JSON and CSV files that constitute a Pokémon Studio project's database |
|       `graphics` | Folder containing the graphic resources for Pokémon and items                                |

The `Data` folder is divided in two folders:
- The `Text` folder regroups the CSV files that contains the names and descriptions of the database entries.
- The `Studio` folder is divided in 6 sub-folders with self-explanatory names. Each of these sub-folders regroup the related JSON files.

The `graphics` folder is divided in three folders:
- The `characters` folder contains the Pokémon overworld sprites.
- The `icons` folder contains the items sprites.
- The `pokedex` folder is divided in 7 sub-folders with self-explanatory names. Each of these sub-folders contain the Pokémon sprites for battle, PC and Pokédex entries.

Here is complete representation of a generation folder structure:

This structure replicates exactly a Pokémon Studio project's structure so that people can just download and copy an entire version folder's content directly in their project.

## How to contribute

### Setting up
First thing you should do is to get yourself a copy of this repository on your computer if you did not already, depending on the permissions you have, there are two options:
- If you have the necessary permissions (e.g. you have been given collaborator rights) you can directly clone the repository
- If you don't have the necessary permissions, you can fork the repository, it will essentially "copy" it for yourself but with rights to create branches, make commits etc...

Once you have a local copy of the repository, you will have to setup a Pokémon Studio project to ease your work, because working directly on the JSON files is possible, but definitely harder.
- Create a new Pokémon Studio project and name it as you want
- Go in your project's folder that was created and open the `Data/Studio` folder
- Delete the `abilities`, `dex`, `items`, `moves`, `pokemon` and `types` folders
- Go back to the root folder of your project and copy the `Data` folder of the generation you are working on (see next part) directly into it
- You can now work on this generation files 

### Adding information to the datapacks
If you want to contribute by adding missing information to the datapack you must go look at the [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/PokemonWorkshop/projects/2) and see which tasks need to be done. Once you decided which task you would like to do, you can ask a contributor in the [psdk-database](https://discord.com/channels/143824995867557888/701413380728029194) channel on discord to assign it to you.

When that's done, here are the steps you should follow:
- Checkout the `gen-packs` branch, this is the default branch where all changes are gathered.
- Create a new branch and name it accordingly to your task.
- Do the task using the project you created (see previous part).
- Create a Pull request to the `gen-packs` branch of this repository (don't forget to link the task to your request).

Once the pull request is created, other contributors will verify it, eventually comment and ask to correct anything they think is an error, and finally merge the work when everything is ok.

### Reviewing changes made by peer contributors
If you want to contribute by reviewing you can:
- Look at the pending [pull requests](https://github.com/PokemonWorkshop/GameDataPacks/pulls) and add a comment if you see anything that you think might be an error.
- Check the [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/PokemonWorkshop/projects/2) and ask other contributors to be assigned on a reviewing task that needs to be done.
